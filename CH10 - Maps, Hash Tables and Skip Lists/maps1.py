# Maps are similar to dictionaries. So just think dictionary. 

# The Map ADT

"""

M[k] =v: Associates value v with key k in map M.
del M[k]: Removes from map M the item with key equal to K
len(M): Returns the number of items in map M.
iter(M): The default iteration for a map gernerates a sequence of keys
			in the map. In python this is implemented with __iter__ and it
			allows loops of the form for k in M.
